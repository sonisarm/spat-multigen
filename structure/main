Code in R and bash to analyse the structure of the samples with different methods:
(1) STRUCTURE v2.3.4 (Evanno et al. 2005) that identifies the K (unknown) genetic clusters of origin of the sampled individuals and assigns the individuals to the inferred clusters. 
We ran 500,000 Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations after a burn-in of 100,000 iterations for K values (i.e., number of genetic clusters) between 1â€“10, with 15 iterations for each value of K. 
The most probable value of K was determined using the Delta-K method of Evanno et al. (2005), as implemented in STRUCTURE SELECTOR (Li and Liu 2018). The iterations were clustered with CLUMPAK (Kopelman et al. 2015). 

(2) TESS3 (Caye et al. 2016) in R to estimate spatial genetic structure based on the GPS coordinates for each individual. 
The best number of k-clusters was selected based on the lowest cross-validation scores. 

(3) Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPCs) in the R package adegenet (Jombart and Bateman 2008). 
DAPC is a multivariate analysis free of Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibrium assumptions. 
Sampling locations were used a priori for population grouping, and the optimal number of PCs to retain was optimized with the xvalDapc function (Jombart and Bateman 2008). 
We graphically visualized the two discriminant functions using scatter plots in R.
